To cater for all ability levels, I've also included a set of instructions so that anyone can have a play.

### Instructions: 

1. First off, download the wonderful Processing. Processing is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows and is a flexible software sketchbook and language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. [Download Processing here](https://processing.org/download/?processing)

2. [Download](https://github.com/melaniehuang/Miro/archive/master.zip) this zip for all the files needed to get this digital artwork onto your computer.

3. Open Processing and open the file "miro.pde" and press the 'Play' button in the top left-hand corner. It should look something like this:

4. Change the colours by having a play with the numbers. I have put comments that look like this to guide you in how to change these colours.

` /* Hello I'm a comment! */ `

Then create, create, create.

If you had fun with this, Processing has a wealth of beginner to advanced [Processing tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/) to get you inspired and started.

Or if Javascript is more your flavour - There is also an awesome Processing inspired library [here](http://p5js.org/) called p5.js to get your artworks straight into the browser.
