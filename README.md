To cater for all ability levels, I've also included a set of instructions so that anyone can get started on your own computer.

1. To create this artwork you'll need Processing. 
Processing is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows and is a flexible software sketchbook and language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. [Download Processing here](https://processing.org/download/?processing)

2. Open a new Processing sketch and copy and paste the following code from [here](https://github.com/melaniehuang/Miro/blob/master/miro.pde).

3. Save the file as "miro".

4. Have a play with the numbers. I have put comments that look like this 

` /* Hello I'm a comment! */ `

5. Create, create, create.

If you had fun with this, Processing has a wealth of beginner to advanced [Processing tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/) to get you inspired and started.

Or if Javascript is more your flavour - There is also an awesome Processing inspired library [here](http://p5js.org/) to get your artwork into the browsers.
